# Building Applications with Vector Databases – Free & Open Source Notebooks

Welcome! 👋
This repository is a collection of hands-on notebooks originally inspired by **DeepLearning.AI in collaboration with Pinecone**.

✨ The twist? Unlike the original course notebooks that rely on **OpenAI models (which cost money)**, this repo uses **free and open-source alternatives** — so you can run everything locally with **zero extra cost**!

---

## 🚀 What’s Inside?

* ✅ All course notebooks adapted for **free use**
* ✅ Replaced **OpenAI models** with **Gemini**
* ✅ Replaced **OpenAI embeddings (1536-dim)** with **JinaAI embeddings (768-dim)**
* ✅ Fixed dimension mismatches and other common errors
* ✅ No API billing worries — everything runs with free models

## 📖 Course Modules

This repo covers six powerful applications of vector databases and embeddings:

1. **Semantic Search** – Find documents based on *meaning* instead of exact keywords.
2. **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** – Generate fact-based answers using retrieved knowledge + Gemini.
3. **Recommender Systems** – Suggest items to users using similarity and personalization.
4. **Hybrid Search** – Mix **keyword** + **semantic search** for more accurate results.
5. **Facial Similarity Search** – Compare and find visually similar faces with embeddings.
6. **Anomaly Detection** – Detect unusual patterns and outliers in data.
